The purpose of this repo is to gather together my Unity projects.

## Contents

#### [BeautifulGraphs](https://github.com/Siiir/unity-BeautifulGraphs)
Graph visualization featuring **beatiful**, **lively** (time dependant) and **configurable** **graphs** from which user can choose from.

#### [Satellites](https://github.com/Siiir/unity-Satellites)
Project simulating **interactions** between **celestial bodies**.

Especially *gravity force* has very interesting **optimized algorithm in C#** for many-to-many interation.

#### [PlatformerMicrogame](https://github.com/Siiir/unity-PlatformerMicrogame)
This is only an altered version of Unity's “2D Platformer Microgame“ template with some custom modifications (mainly visual).

With my modifications I was aiming to make it more crazy, orginal, eye-catching.
